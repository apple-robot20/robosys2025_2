NAGOYA -- A bank here and one of its employees who saved an elderly woman from losing money to a medical expense refund scam received certificates of gratitude from Aichi Prefectural Police's Midori Police Station on Nov. 27.

Takashi Kondo, 52, and his colleague at The Hekikai Shinkin Bank Ltd.'s Narumi branch in Nagoya's Midori Ward received the certificates from the police station after Kondo was credited with preventing a woman in her 70s from falling victim to a scam when she sought to increase her account's withdrawal limit to 930,000 yen (about $5,950) at around 2 p.m. on Oct. 22.


Finding her request suspicious, Kondo gently inquired further, and the woman explained that a man claiming to be a ward office employee had called her, saying, "You need to complete a medical expense refund procedure." He persuaded her to speak with the police, who confirmed that the call was fraudulent.


Kondo commented, "In our role as a local financial institution, I'm glad we were able to prevent such fraud." Station chief Tadafumi Kimura, while emphasizing financial institutions' role as the "last line of defense," called for vigilance, saying, "If you feel anything is suspicious, contact the police immediately."

According to the prefectural police's Organized Crime Special Investigation Division, the number of special fraud cases in the prefecture from January to October this year increased by 377 cases compared to the same period last year, totaling 1,603. Damages rose by approximately 3.86 billion yen (about $24.69 million), reaching about 6.68 billion yen (about $42.73 million).
